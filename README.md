AWS Penetration Test Request Form Info Generator
================================================

Generates a list of instance IDs and IP addresses using an interactive
commandline script. The output is suitable for submitting the form penetration
request form at https://aws.amazon.com/forms/penetration-testing-request.

The script utilizes the AWS CLI. It generates a list of VPCs based on whether
they contain an instance tagged `Name=Nessus`, `Value=true`. Of those VPCs, only
instances in a _running_ state are included in the output.

Amazon restricts which types of instances may be scanned for vulnerabilities.
The output uses a whitelist of instance sizes which omits the t1.micro and
m1.small sizes on the restricted list.

Requirements
------------

AWS CLI:
https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

### macOS install

```
sudo pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade awscli
```

Configuration
-------------

The AWS profiles are hard-coded in the batch script to `development`,
`production`, and `customer`.

The headings of the credentials file in your home directory
(~/.aws/credentials or c:\Users\user\.aws\credentials).

The credentials must match the hard-coded profile references at the top of the
script.

```
[development]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAICDDQ7HNOUFQKRZQ
aws_secret_access_key = 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

[production]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIWK4NACG54KKIQIQ
aws_secret_access_key = 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

[customer]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAJHQD7J7AAAISF7HQ
aws_secret_access_key = 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
```

Usage
-----

The prompts will generate all the relevant target and source IPs,
along with instance IDs for a specific region in a single AWS account.

### Windows

From Windows Explorer, double-click the `aws_pentest_form_data_generator.bat`
file to begin. The prompts will generate all the relevant target and source IPs,
along with instance IDs for a specific region in a single AWS account.

Do not attempt to run the array.bat file directly - it is a support library
for the main batch file.

### MacOS/Linux

Be sure the shell script is executable.

```
chmod 755 aws_pentest_form_data_generator.sh
```

In Terminal, navigate to the `aws_pentest_form_data_generator.sh` and run it.

```
./aws_pentest_form_data_generator.sh`
```

Output
------

The separate IP files are intended to fill individual scan zones in the
application super administrator accont of Tenable SecurityCenter and the asset
lists in the organization account. The other two bulk files can be copy/pasted
to the AWS form.
